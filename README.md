# Project Diagrams and Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains all the **diagrams and guides** that will be used to facilitate the development of the project. The diagrams provide visual representations of the system architecture, relationships between different classes, and workflows, ensuring a clear understanding of the project’s structure. 

## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Class Diagrams**: Visual representations of the relationships between various classes in the system.
- **CRC Cards**: Descriptions of class responsibilities and collaborators.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Flow of operations and interactions between different components of the system.
- **Flowcharts**: Step-by-step workflows of key processes.
- **Guides**: Additional documents that provide detailed instructions for using the diagrams and implementing the project components.

## Purpose
The diagrams and guides in this repository are intended to:
- Help developers and stakeholders understand the system architecture and design.
- Provide a reference for implementation decisions and system navigation.
- Ensure consistent understanding across teams within the organization.

## Usage
